## Garage Opener ##
### Description ###

This is a remote garage door opener application that I am writing using react native. This is the
client side of the application designed to run on iOS or Android. The actual data and control
functionality comes from a remote server running a MQTT broker. As I work on this project, I will
update the section below with the server API required for the client application to function.


### Server API ###
This section will contain the MQTT topics and messages that the server should respond to.
